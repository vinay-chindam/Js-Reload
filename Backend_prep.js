Node js:
Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript code outside of a browser â€” typically on servers.

Chrome:V8
firefox:Spyder monkey

LTs even odd theory

A REST API is an interface that allows clients (like browsers or mobile apps) to communicate with servers using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

Cors (cross origin resource sharing)

Browser side thing
Can pass through things like postman

app.use(cors()) allows all domains to intereact and risky
app.use((cors({
  origin:some domain that requests are allowed from

}}}

JWT

              Json web token (stateless )
              stored on client side
              header:
              payload:
              signature

how it works:

header contains meta data like what algo is used
payload mostly contains user data and expiry etc

server uses a secret key  and combo of header and payload to generate a signature 
All these three are appended and called jwt
now server stores secret key

when ever user relogins  a jwt will be there with request and its verified at server

1 splits using delimiter
2 decoded using header,payload and secret key to achieve desired signature
3 compare desired and actual signature which came along requrest
4 if matches then user is ligitamate
5 else jwt has been currupted



This is how JWT works
