Annotations:

The @Component annotation in Spring is a core stereotype annotation used to mark a Java class as a Spring-managed bean. 
  When Spring performs component scanning, it automatically detects classes annotated with @Component and registers them in the ApplicationContext, 
  making them eligible for dependency injection
