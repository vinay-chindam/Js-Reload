Hi [Name],

I hope you're doing well! I came across an opening for the [Technical Consultant role at Apty]and I’m very excited about the opportunity. I was wondering if you'd be open to referring me for the position.

I recently completed a software engineering internship at RealPage, where I worked on building reusable React components, optimizing front-end workflows, and integrating APIs for real-time data. I’ve also built full-stack projects like a food delivery app and a shopping cart using React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

I'm confident that my hands-on experience with modern web technologies, along with my strong foundation in JavaScript, Python, and data structures, would make me a great fit for the role.

Please let me know if you’d be comfortable referring me—I’d really appreciate it!

Best regards,
Vinay Chindam
