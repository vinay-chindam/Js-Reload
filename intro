Hello \[Interviewer’s Name], good afternoon.

I’m Vinay Chindam. I graduated in 2024 from Vardhaman College of Engineering with a major in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

For the past year, I’ve been working as a Software Engineer Intern at RealPage India, where I focused on front-end development.
I worked with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React to develop reusable components, design interactive web interfaces, 
and integrate APIs for real-time data updates.

In addition to my internship experience, I’ve also built a couple of full-stack projects.
One is a food delivery web application with real-time order tracking and role-based access,
and the other is a shopping cart application that uses React’s Context API and React Router for seamless navigation and state management.

Outside of coding, I enjoy reading self-help and finance-related books. I also have a deep interest in mythology and like to explore 
cultural stories and legends in my free time.

That’s a brief overview of me.
