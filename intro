Hello [Interviewer’s Name], good afternoon.
	
	I’m Vinay Chindam. I graduated in 2024 from Vardhaman College of Engineering with a major in 
	Electronics and Communication Engineering.
	
	Over the past year, I’ve been working as an intern at RealPage India.
	For the first six months, I worked as a Data Analyst Intern, where I used technologies like SQL and Power BI to build reports
	and deliver actionable insights. 
	In the following six months, I transitioned into a Software Engineer Intern role,
	where I worked with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React to develop reusable components and design interactive web interfaces.

	In addition to my internship experience, I’ve also built a couple of full-stack projects. 
	One is a food delivery web application with real-time order tracking and role-based access, 
	and the other is a shopping cart application that uses React’s Context API and React Router for
	seamless navigation and state management.

	Outside of coding, I enjoy reading self-help and finance-related books.
	I also have a deep interest in mythology and like to explore cultural stories and legends in my free time.

	That’s a brief overview of me.
