Class based and functional based 

Class based:

These are es6 classes that extend react.component
must include a render method to return jsx
can use state via this.state
can use lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, shouldComponentUpdate, etc.
More verbose syntax


Functional components:

These are pure js functions
uses use state for state management
useeffect for lifecycle methods


What is JSX
JSX stands for JavaScript XML,

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. 
Before JSX, you had to use React.createElement() to build UI elements. 
JSX makes this process more readable and expressive, especially when building complex UIs.
It‚Äôs not valid JavaScript on its own‚Äîbut tools like Babel convert it into regular JavaScript that browsers can understand.



üîç How JSX Works Behind the Scenes
You write JSX like <h1>Hello</h1>

Babel transforms it into React.createElement(...)

React uses that to build a virtual DOM

The virtual DOM updates the real DOM efficiently






Life Cycle Methods:

Stages of a componets:

  Mount  create 
  Update  re render due to changes using state
  UnMount  remove from dom

Methods:
At the time of mount
  component did mount
at Updation
  component did update
at deletion
  component will un mount


Summary
Class Component Method	Functional Hook Equivalent
componentDidMount	useEffect(() => {}, [])
componentDidUpdate	useEffect(() => {}, [deps])
componentWillUnmount	useEffect(() => return () => {}, [])
